# 🌍 PASSION for Dermatology: Bridging the Diversity Gap with Pigmented Skin Images from Sub-Saharan Africa

## 🩺 Overview

**PASSION (Pigmented Skin Image Collection)** is a pioneering initiative dedicated to closing the diversity gap in dermatology AI models. This project provides a unique dataset of skin condition images primarily from Sub-Saharan Africa, focusing on diverse pigmented skin types. This dataset is designed to support AI model generalization and includes images of common pediatric conditions, such as eczema, fungal infections, scabies, and impetigo. By utilizing this dataset for AI-powered teledermatology, PASSION aims to improve access to dermatologic care in regions with limited healthcare resources.
